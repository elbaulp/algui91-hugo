<a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a> sigue mejorando,y a una semana escasa de acabar los [cinco cursos][1] que comenzaron hace siete semanas. Ayer anunciaron en su blog que iban a impartir otros cinco cursos a partir del 25 de Junio. A continuación dejo una descripción de cada uno de los cursos.

### Software Testing (CS258)

#### Descripción

When writing software, destruction can be just as valuable as creation. Learn how to catch bugs and break software as you discover different testing methods that will help you build better software.

#### Índice

  * ##### Unit 1: Introduction

    How to become a great software tester

  * ##### Unit 2: Domains, Ranges, Oracles, and Kinds of Testing

    How to think about the different elements of software testing

  * ##### Unit 3: Code Coverage

    How to find parts of a program that need more testing

  * ##### Unit 4: Random Testing

    How to automatically generate test cases that break code in unexpected ways

  * ##### Unit 5: Advanced Random Testing

    How to engineer a sophisticated random test case generator

  * ##### Unit 6: Consequences

    How to deal with lots of bugs, how to take a big input that triggers a bug and make it smaller, how to report a bug, and more!

  * ##### Unit 7: Conclusion

    Summary and tournament results

### Algorithms (CS215)

#### Descripción

Ever played the Kevin Bacon game? This class will show you how it works by giving you an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms that enable you to discover how individuals are connected.

#### Índice

  * ##### Unit 1: A Social Network Magic Trick

    Becoming familiar with algorithm analysis

  * ##### Unit 2: Growth Rates in Social Networks

    Using mathematical tools to analyze how things are connected

  * ##### Unit 5: Systematically understanding relationships

    Least squares;residuals; inference

  * ##### Unit 6: Understanding more complex relationships

    Transformation; smoothing; regression for two or more variables, categorical variables

  * ##### Unit 7: Where to go next
